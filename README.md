# os161-Kernel-Src-Add-System-Call-Assignment
Base kernel suitable for Assignment on adding system calls

This is the `src` folder of OS/161. A folder with the same name is already present in your OS/161 folder, i.e., you already have a `src/` directory in `~/os161/`. It is in `~/os161` that you want to clone this repository. 

Once you clone the repository, you will see that it will have a long name, something like `fall2020-assignment-01-os-161-code-reading-<your-github_username>`, e.g., the cloned repository name for github user `brucewayne` would be named `fall2020-assignment-01-os-161-code-reading-brucewayne`. Despite its name, this directory is actually your 'src/' for your new OS/161 kernel (the new 'src/' you will use for the assignment). 

You don't need to rename the cloned directory to `src`. But, it is fine if you want to change the directory's name to 'src/' for some reason (e.g., name is too long!). Here, you will need to rename the previous `src/` directory or simply delete it.  

Follow the instructions to complete the assignment.
