# os161-Kernel-Src-Add-System-Call-Assignment
Base kernel suitable for Assignment on adding system calls



This is the `src` folder of OS/161. Given that you already installed OS/161 on your Linux, you already have a `src/` directory in `~/os161/src`. Once you clone this repository, you don't need to rename it to `src`. While OS/161's src directory can be placed anywhere in your system, it is convenient to clone this repository at the same level of your original src directory, i.e., ~/os161/. 

Follow the instructions to complete the assignment.
